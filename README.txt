This application was designed for use by Coats for Kids Inc.

Coats for Kids was started by the Kalispell Jaycees over 35 years ago to help underprivileged children receive new warm winter clothing.
The first year they helped 17 families. Through growth and continued commitment to this community, they have now served over 4000 families throughout the entire Flathead Valley.
