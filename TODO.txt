When submitting an inventory item clear the entry boxes

Implemented functionality for adding item types and sizes to comboboxes
Need to figure out how to display specific values in the type and size comboboxes based off of item selected
Look into attribute values passed by the combobox selection event; may be able to have Update_Entry_Boxes func update both
add and remove entry boxes. If not will just need a separate function

Adding an inventory item:
1. Select an item
2. Based upon that item selected present the available types and sizes in comboboxes
3. Type in Quantity
4. Submit
5. After submission clear boxes






#### Test DB values through python3 interactive session ####
import sqlite3 as sql
con = sql.connect('CoatsDB')
cur = con.cursor()

cur.fetchall()

import sqlite3 as sql
con = sql.connect('CoatsDB')
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute("insert into Hat (Hat_Type) values ('Female');")

DELETE FROM table WHERE search_condition;

cur.execute("delete from Hat where Hat_Type =  'Test'")
