See if the underscore function can be turned into a lambda statement
When submitting an inventory item clear the entry boxes

Implemented functionality for adding item types and sizes to comboboxes
Need to figure out how to display specific item types and sizes
based off what item name is selected on the add inventory window






#### Test DB values through python3 interactive session ####
import sqlite3 as sql
con = sql.connect('CoatsDB')
cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute('Select * from Boots;')
cur.fetchall()


Revise Add_Item function. Not properly sending type and size.
Sending two variables no matter what, need to send one
Use Boot_Sizes values to populate comboboxes on startup

Adding an inventory item:
1. Select an item
2. Based upon that item selected present the available types and sizes in comboboxes
3. Type in Quantity
4. Submit
5. After submission clear boxes
